Creating a maze suitable for reinforcement learning involves a few steps. You need to generate a random maze that is complex enough to challenge the algorithm, and then represent this maze in a way that can be easily used by the RL algorithm. Here's a step-by-step guide to achieve this:

Generate a Random Maze:
You can use algorithms like Prim's or Kruskal's to generate a random maze. These algorithms ensure that the maze is perfect (i.e., there's exactly one path between any two points).

Represent the Maze:
The maze can be represented as a 2D array, where 0 represents a passable cell and 1 represents a wall.

Ensure Complexity:
Introduce a certain level of complexity by adding loops or multiple branches that make simple search algorithms suboptimal.
